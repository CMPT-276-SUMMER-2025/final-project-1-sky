## How to Deploy Locally
1) Clone this repository by clicking the green `Code` button. Select either HTTPS or SSH, depending on the connection used on your local machine and click the copy button next to the link. To find out if you are using an SSH connection, type `ssh -T git@github.com` in any terminal. If there is output such as "Hi `username`! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access." then you are using SSH, and if not then you will need to clone using HTTPS. 
2) Navigate to a directory that you want to put the project in. 
3) In the terminal, type `git clone` followed by `cntrl-v` (paste) to paste the github repository URL. 
4) Navigate to the project using `cd final-project-1-sky`
5) In the project root, run `npm install` to install all necessary packages.
6) Create a file called `.env.local` in the root folder for API keys. Then edit it and fill in the required values.
7) run `npm run dev` and open the localhost link that is provided in the terminal (usually localhost:3000)
