## How to Deploy Locally
1) Clone this repository by clicking the green `Code` button. Select either HTTPS or SSH, depending on the connection used on your local machine and click the copy button next to the link. To find out if you are using an SSH connection, type `ssh -T git@github.com` in any terminal. If there is output such as "Hi `username`! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access." then you are using SSH, and if not then you will need to clone using HTTPS. 
2) In a terminal, navigate to a directory that you want to run the project in.

>NOTE: The following steps assume you have `git` and `node.js` installed on your local machine.
>You can download these tools with the following links and follow the instructions on the respective websites:
>node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/download
>git: https://git-scm.com/downloads

4) In the terminal, type `git clone` followed by space and then press `cntrl-v` (paste) to paste the github repository URL. 
5) Navigate to the project using `cd final-project-1-sky`
6) In the project root, run `npm install` to install all necessary packages. 
7) Create a file called `.env.local` in the root folder for API keys. The names are the following for the APIs:
`OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` for <strong>OpenWeatherAPI</strong>, and `GEONAMES_USERNAME` for <strong>GeoNamesAPI</strong>
8) run `npm run dev` and open the localhost link that is provided in the terminal (usually named localhost:3000) to run the application locally.
